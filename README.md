# Language Translation with GUI using Python

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates language translation from Odia to English and then to Hindi using the `translate` library. The script also incorporates a graphical user interface (GUI) created using the `tkinter` library, allowing users to upload input files and visualize the translation process.

## Features

- GUI-based interface for ease of use.
- Language translation from Odia to English and then from English to Hindi.
- Supports translation of text files.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- `translate` library (install using `pip install translate`)
- `tkinter` library (should be included by default with most Python installations)

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Namanbhansali59/odia_to_english_hindi_NLP.git
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   
   cd language-translation-gui
   
3. Run the scrip

  python main.py

3. The GUI will open. Click the "Select Input File" button to choose an Odia text file for translation.

4. After selecting the input file, the "Translate and Save" button will become active. Click it to start the translation process.

5. The translated outputs (in English and Hindi) will be saved as english_output.txt and hindi_output.txt respectively.

Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue.

Note: This code is meant for educational and demonstrative purposes. It uses the translate and tkinter libraries to showcase language translation with a GUI. For more comprehensive and production-level solutions, consider using larger NLP libraries and models.
